# Machine Learning Model Comparison

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive comparison of different machine learning models applied to a dataset to predict outcomes based on various input features. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of several models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R^2) are used to assess each model's accuracy and predictive power.

## Models Evaluated

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet powerful model for predicting a quantitative response.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for regression that uses multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that combines the predictions from several decision tree models.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for regression tasks.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a generic dataset that contains various features necessary to train the models. It has been split into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance accurately.

## Performance Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing a measure of the quality of the estimator with the same units as the response variable.
- **R^2 (Coefficient of Determination)**: Represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's predicted from the independent variables.

## Installation

To run the code, you will need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the models and visualize their performance.
